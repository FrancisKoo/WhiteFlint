    Engine Project Overview
========================================================================

This project demonstrates how to get started authoring Windows Runtime 
classes directly with standard C++, using the Project Reunion and 
C++/WinRT packages to generate implementation headers from interface 
(IDL) files.  The generated Windows Runtime component binary and WinMD 
files should then be bundled with the app consuming them.

Steps:
1. Create an interface (IDL) file to define your Windows Runtime class, 
    its default interface, and any other interfaces it implements.
2. Build the project once to generate module.g.cpp, module.h.cpp, and
    implementation templates under the "Generated Files" folder, as 
    well as skeleton class definitions under "Generated Files\sources".  
3. Use the skeleton class definitions for reference to implement your
    Windows Runtime classes.
